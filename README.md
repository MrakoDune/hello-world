# hello-world

You know what guys,
  I started coding because it was a form of art where technicality was required
  It was a skill where you could save the whole world with a computer
  You could prevent wars by protecting some nuclear codes
  All thanks to coders we live in a world a bit safer than the last minute
  and that is why I say
  
  CODERS DESERVE MONEY TOO
